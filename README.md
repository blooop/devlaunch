## Installation

### Pixi (Recommended)

```bash
pixi global install --channel conda-forge --channel https://prefix.dev/blooop devlaunch
```

This installs `devlaunch` along with `devpod` and all dependencies automatically.

### Pip

```bash
pip install devlaunch
```

Note: When using pip, you must install [devpod](https://devpod.sh/docs/getting-started/install) separately.

### Shell Completions

After installation, set up shell completions:

```bash
dl --install
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart your terminal
```

## Usage

```bash
dl                               # Interactive workspace selector (fzf)
dl <user/repo>                   # Start workspace and attach shell
dl <user/repo> <cmd>             # Run workspace command (stop, code, etc.)
dl <user/repo> -- <command>      # Run shell command in workspace
```

## Workspace Sources

```bash
dl myproject                     # Existing workspace by name
dl user/repo                     # Create from GitHub repo
dl user/repo@branch              # Create from specific branch
dl ./path                        # Create from local path
```

## Workspace Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dl <user/repo> stop` | Stop the workspace |
| `dl <user/repo> rm, prune` | Delete the workspace |
| `dl <user/repo> code` | Open in VS Code |
| `dl <user/repo> restart` | Stop and start (no rebuild) |
| `dl <user/repo> recreate` | Recreate container |
| `dl <user/repo> reset` | Clean slate (remove all, recreate) |
| `dl <user/repo> -- <command>` | Run shell command in workspace |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--devcontainer <variant\|path>` | Use a non-default `devcontainer.json`. A bare name means `.devcontainer/<name>/devcontainer.json`. Stored with the workspace, so pass it once. |

Projects with demanding devcontainers — several variants, compose sidecars, or a
host-side `initializeCommand` that has to tell branch workspaces apart — are
covered in [docs/devcontainer-projects.md](docs/devcontainer-projects.md).

## GitHub Authentication

Every workspace `dl` opens inherits the host's GitHub login, so `gh` is already
authenticated inside the container and the devcontainer.json does not have to
arrange anything for it. devpod forwards the ssh agent and git credentials on its
own, but nothing else carries `gh`.

devlaunch takes the token from `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `gh auth token`,
whichever answers first, and hands it to the container as `GH_TOKEN`. That reaches
any image and any container user, unlike a bind-mount of `~/.config/gh`, and it
works whether the host keeps its token in `hosts.yml` or in a keyring. The token
is passed to devpod through a private file and through devpod's own environment,
never on a command line, so it does not appear in `ps`. The container still needs
`gh` installed for the login to be of any use. Check a workspace with:

```bash
dl <workspace> -- gh auth status
```

### Who gets the token

Everything running in the container does — including a `postCreateCommand` from a
repo you did not write. `dl someone/repo` builds and runs that project's
devcontainer with your GitHub token in its environment, and a `gh auth login` token
usually carries `repo`, `workflow`, `gist` and `read:org` scopes. devpod already
forwards the ssh agent to every workspace, so this is not a new trust boundary, but
it is a wider one. Skip it for a repo you have not read:

```bash
DEVLAUNCH_NO_GH_TOKEN=1 dl someone/repo
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEVLAUNCH_NO_GH_TOKEN=1` | Do not forward the host's GitHub login into workspaces |

### When the token changes

`dl` refreshes the token on every start, so rotating it on the host is enough for
any workspace that gets started or restarted afterwards. Attaching to a workspace
that is *already running* skips that step, and the token it was given at startup
stays in place — including one it was given before you set
`DEVLAUNCH_NO_GH_TOKEN`. Run `dl <workspace> restart` to replace it.

## Global Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dl --ls` | List all workspaces |
| `dl --install` | Install shell completions |
| `dl --purge [-y]` | Remove all devlaunch data |
| `dl --prune-worktrees [days]` | Remove unused worktrees (default: 30 days) |
| `dl --refresh` | Refresh completion cache |
| `dl --help, -h` | Show this help |
| `dl --version` | Show version |

## Examples

```bash
dl                               # Select workspace with fzf
dl devpod                        # Open existing workspace
dl loft-sh/devpod                # Create from GitHub
dl blooop/devlaunch@main         # Create from specific branch
dl ./my-project                  # Create from local folder
dl blooop/devlaunch code         # Open in VS Code
dl blooop/devlaunch -- make test # Run command in workspace
dl blooop/devlaunch stop         # Stop workspace
```

## Features

- **Fuzzy Selection**: When called without arguments, uses fzf for interactive workspace selection
- **Smart Completion**: Tab completion for workspaces, GitHub repos (owner/repo format), and paths
- **GitHub Shorthand**: Use `owner/repo` instead of full URLs - automatically expands to `github.com/owner/repo`
- **Branch Support**: Specify branches with `owner/repo@branch` syntax
- **Fast Autocomplete**: Completion cache for ~3ms response time (vs ~700ms without cache)

## Worktree Backend

For git repositories, devlaunch uses an efficient worktree backend by default:

- **Efficient Storage**: Repos are cloned once to `~/.cache/devlaunch/repos/owner/repo/`, then git worktrees are created for each branch
- **Shared Git Objects**: All branches share git objects, saving disk space
- **Lazy Fetch**: Remote updates are only fetched if the configured interval has elapsed (default: 1 hour)

### Container Sharing Mode

Use `--shared` to share a single container across multiple branches of the same repo:

```bash
dl --shared owner/repo@branch1  # Creates container "owner-repo"
dl --shared owner/repo@branch2  # Reuses "owner-repo" container
```

### Pre-warming

Use `--warm` to prepare a workspace without attaching a shell:

```bash
dl --warm owner/repo@branch  # Creates container in background
```

## Shell Completion

After running `dl --install`, you get intelligent tab completion:

- Workspace names from your devpod list
- Known GitHub owners and repositories from your workspaces
- File/directory paths when starting with `./`, `/`, or `~`
- All global flags (`--ls`, `--install`, etc.) and workspace commands

## Development

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for environment management.

```bash
# Run tests
pixi run test

# Run full CI suite
pixi run ci

# Format and lint
pixi run style
```

`pixi run test` skips the e2e suite, which needs a Docker daemon to create real
workspaces with. The devcontainer carries one (the `docker-in-docker` feature),
so from inside it:

```bash
# Run the e2e suite against a real devpod
pixi run test-e2e
```

This is why the devcontainer does not use `--network=host`: a nested daemon needs
a network namespace of its own, or it fights the host's Docker over the shared
`docker0` bridge and its NAT rules. `test/docker/docker-compose.test.yml` runs the
same suite in a standalone dind container if you would rather not rebuild.
