## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.7] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- `--devcontainer <variant|path>` to select a non-default `devcontainer.json`, for
  repos carrying several variants. A bare name is passed to devpod as a
  `--devcontainer-id`, which resolves the spec's
  `.devcontainer/<name>/devcontainer.json` location; a path is passed as
  `--devcontainer-path`. Accepts `--devcontainer=x` too, and tab-completes the
  repo's variant directories. devpod stores the choice with the workspace, so it
  only has to be passed once.
- `DEVLAUNCH_WORKSPACE_ID` is injected into workspace initialization (via devpod's
  `--init-env`), so a project's host-side `initializeCommand` can tell branch
  workspaces apart. devpod passes the hook no workspace identity of its own, and
  devlaunch clones every branch to `<repo>/<branch>`, so a project deriving
  per-checkout names from the path cannot distinguish them. See
  `docs/devcontainer-projects.md`.
- Worktree backend for efficient multi-branch workspace management
  - Clones repositories once, then creates git worktrees for each branch
  - Shares git objects across all branches for faster workspace creation
  - Automatic backend selection based on workspace spec (owner/repo format uses worktree)
  - Backend override via `--backend worktree|devpod` flag or `DEVLAUNCH_BACKEND` env var
- New worktree module with:
  - `RepositoryManager` for cloning and managing base repositories
  - `WorktreeManager` for creating and managing git worktrees
  - `WorkspaceManager` for DevPod workspace lifecycle with worktree backing
  - `BranchManager` for branch operations (create, track, push)
  - `MetadataStorage` for persistent worktree tracking
- Configurable worktree directories via `~/.config/devlaunch/config.toml`
- `--purge` command to remove all devlaunch data (repos, worktrees, caches)
- All data now stored in `~/.cache/devlaunch/` (XDG compliant)

### Fixed
- Cloning a git-lfs repository no longer fails during checkout. Workspaces are
  cloned from the local bare cache, which holds no LFS objects, so the smudge
  filter aborted; LFS content is now pulled from the real remote after the origin
  URL is set. A failed or interrupted pull is retried on the next run — whether
  content is missing is decided by looking for pointer files, so a workspace
  cannot get stuck holding pointers.
- `dl <ws>` no longer starts the session in `$HOME` for projects that set a custom
  `workspaceFolder`. It passed a guessed `--workdir /workspaces/<id>`, and devpod
  falls back to `$HOME` when that path does not exist in the container.
- `dl <ws>` no longer opens VS Code on top of the terminal shell it attaches when
  devpod's default IDE is configured. `dl <ws> code` is unaffected.
- A failed `devpod delete` no longer strands a workspace. devpod re-parses the
  workspace's `devcontainer.json` to tear the container down, so deletion fails if
  that file has moved — and the local clone was removed regardless, leaving devpod
  with no config to retry from. The clone is now kept unless devpod succeeded.
- Proper exception handling for workspace creation failures
- Pylint compliance for all worktree module code

### Removed
- `devlaunch.dl.get_container_workdir()`. It built a guessed container path that
  is no longer passed to `devpod ssh` (see the `workspaceFolder` fix above), so it
  had no correct use. `workspace_ssh(workdir=...)` still accepts an explicit
  override.
