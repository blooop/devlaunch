# Agent Instructions

## Development Environment

This project uses a devcontainer with pixi for environment management.

### Available Tools

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Available via `pixi run gh` or directly if using a login shell. Authentication comes from the host: `dl` forwards the host's token into every workspace it opens as `GH_TOKEN`, and this project's devcontainer also mounts `~/.config/gh` for containers started some other way (VS Code, plain `devpod up`).

### Running Commands

When using pixi tasks, prefer `pixi run <task>`. See `pixi task list` for available tasks.

For tools installed as dependencies (like `gh`), you can run them via:
- `pixi run gh <args>` - works in any shell
- `gh <args>` - works in login shells (`bash -l -c '...'`)

## Documentation Maintenance

- **Keep README up to date**: When modifying CLI commands, flags, or usage patterns, update the README.md to reflect the current tool behavior. Run `pixi run dl --help` to see the current help output and ensure the README matches.
