# Measuring a launch

Where a launch's seconds go, how to get that as JSON, and how the trend on
`main` is built.

## One round trip per question

Every `devpod` call costs about 0.45s, far more than `dl` itself spends on
anything. That one figure sets the shape of the whole program: a command reads
the workspace list at most once, and everything a container needs on the way in,
naming it and then the tools probe, rides a single setup pass. So an interactive
`dl <ws>` and a one-shot `dl <ws> -- <cmd>` cost the same trips.

## Measuring launch time

Set `DEVLAUNCH_TIMING=1` and a `dl` command ends with one summary on stderr,
naming each subprocess round trip and the total. Unset (or `0`) records nothing
and prints nothing.

**Every second quoted in this section is one host's session on 2026-08-14, and
that host was running the Python build `0.1.0` replaced.** The formats are
current: the stage names are frozen in `rust/devlaunch-core/src/timing.rs` and
pinned by its tests. The seconds are not. They describe an implementation that
no longer ships, and no host has measured the Rust binary into this prose, which
is deliberate rather than a gap to fill by hand. The numbers to trust are the
ones [the trend on main](#the-trend-on-main) publishes per commit, and it has
published nothing since the cutover
([#292](https://github.com/blooop/devlaunch/issues/292)). The Rust build's own
per-stage decomposition was re-measured nested inside this repo's devcontainer
([#388](https://github.com/blooop/devlaunch/issues/388)), which is
docker-in-docker rather than a host, so what it carries across is the per-stage
arithmetic and not anyone's wall clock.

Captured from a real warm launch (the launch's own output elided):

```bash
$ DEVLAUNCH_TIMING=1 dl-next blooop/mcp-devtasks -- true
...
dl-timing: devpod status 0.454s
dl-timing: gh auth token 0.036s
dl-timing: devpod ssh 1.952s
dl-timing: total 2.444s (in-process, excluding interpreter startup)
```

### The same launch, machine-readable

`DEVLAUNCH_TIMING=json` swaps that prose for one document on a single
`dl-timing-json:` line, so a trend job can read a launch without scraping
prose. It decomposes the launch into five **ownership-boundary stages**, one
per party that could actually make it faster, with the round trips nested
inside the stage that paid for them:

| stage | what it owns |
|---|---|
| `handoff` | the gap between the keystroke that resolved to this exec and dl starting (see the stamps below) |
| `host-prep` | the host's own git work: the bare clone and its fetches, the lock waits, the LFS probe and, for an LFS repo, the cache's LFS fetch and the workspace's materialization out of it. Plus the `gh auth token` trip, wherever on the launch it falls |
| `devpod-up` | the arm that gets a container running: the existence probe and, when it is not running, the `up` itself. On a warm launch that arm is the probe alone |
| `tools` | the probe trip and the conditional lend, including staging the payload tar |
| `attach` | the last trip, into the running command |

Two rules are worth knowing before reading one:

- **A stage that never ran is absent, not zero.** A warm launch reports no
  `host-prep` at all, because it did none. A stage that failed is present,
  timed up to the failure, and marked `failed`.
- **A stage totals over its whole arm**, not just over its round trips, so the
  host-side work between two spawns is attributed rather than lost. Stages
  never double-count each other: `tools` runs inside the launch `devpod-up`
  brackets, and those seconds are charged to `tools` alone. The in-process
  stages therefore add up to the total. Measured on a real cold launch below,
  they came to 20.834s against a 20.834s total.

`handoff` is the exception to that sum, and the only one: it ends where
`total` begins, so it is time the process could not have measured from inside
itself. A consumer adding stages up against the total leaves it out.

Two optional environment variables let whatever launches `dl`, a shell
function or an agent front-end, close the loop on the time before dl existed.
Both are Unix epoch seconds, which is what `date +%s.%N` prints:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `DEVLAUNCH_HANDOFF_T0` | the keystroke that resolved to this exec. Becomes the `handoff` stage, the only measurement of exec plus interpreter startup there is, since `total` begins after both |
| `DEVLAUNCH_PREWARM_FIRED_AT` | when a prewarm (`dl <ws> up`) was fired for this workspace, if one was |

With the prewarm stamp set, the document also reports what that prewarm was
worth: the head start it bought, and which shape the launch then took. `hit`
means the workspace was already up, `partial` means this launch queued behind a
prewarm still running, `miss` means this launch ran the `up` itself. dl decides
that, not the firer: a prewarm is fired and forgotten, so only the launch that
followed can see whether it helped. **A stamp that is missing, unreadable, or
ahead of this clock reports nothing** rather than a zero. An absent handoff
and an instantaneous one are different facts, and a trend cannot tell them
apart once one is written as the other.

Captured from a real warm launch with both stamps set (one line, wrapped and
elided here for reading):

```bash
$ DEVLAUNCH_TIMING=json DEVLAUNCH_HANDOFF_T0=$(date +%s.%N) \
    DEVLAUNCH_PREWARM_FIRED_AT=... dl-next blooop/mcp-devtasks -- true
...
dl-timing-json: {"total": 2.210768, "total_epoch": "in-process, excluding interpreter startup",
  "stages": [{"stage": "handoff",   "seconds": 0.130542, "outcome": "ok", "spans": []},
             {"stage": "host-prep", "seconds": 0.027799, "outcome": "ok",
              "spans": [{"label": "gh auth token", "seconds": 0.02747}]},
             {"stage": "devpod-up", "seconds": 0.455188, "outcome": "ok",
              "spans": [{"label": "devpod status", "seconds": 0.455158}]},
             {"stage": "attach",    "seconds": 1.726961, "outcome": "ok",
              "spans": [{"label": "devpod ssh", "seconds": 1.72661}]}],
  "prewarm": {"head_start_seconds": 42.489243, "shape": "hit"}}
```

Stages appear in the order the launch first entered them, and only the ones it
reached appear at all. This warm launch built nothing and lent nothing, so
there is no `tools` stage and no `devpod up` inside `devpod-up`. That
`handoff: 0.131s` is the exec and the interpreter start, which nothing else
measures.

The cold launch of the same repo, same host and session, decomposed as:
`host-prep` 2.257s (`git clone --bare` 1.602 + `git fetch` 0.427 + workspace
`git clone` 0.065 + LFS probe 0.002 + token 0.034), `devpod-up` 5.848s (`devpod
up` 5.113 of it), `tools` 10.224s (probe trip 1.584 + `tools tar` 0.111 +
transfer 8.445), `attach` 2.505s. That is 20.834s of stages against a 20.834s total.

For before/after numbers, `scripts/bench_launch.py` runs a command N times and
reports the median, one command per side of a change:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_launch.py -n 5 -- dl-next owner/repo -- true   # warm launch
```

(`pixi run bench -n 5 -- ...` in the devcontainer.) It reports no median if any
run fails, so a broken launch cannot pass as a fast one. See `bench_launch.py
--help` for `--before`, the per-run reset that makes a *cold* median cold and
whose `rm --force` also succeeds on the first run when there is nothing to
remove yet, and for why its wall clock and `dl-timing: total` are not the
same quantity. For scale, on the host the session above was captured on, the
warm median over 5 runs was 2.176s. Running the cold recipe exactly as the
epilog writes it, `-n 5` with the container recreated per run, gave a median of
15.899s (runs: 15.9, 20.0, 15.2, 15.7, 17.8). Read that as the cost of
recreating a container, not of a first-ever launch: the reset removes the
workspace but leaves the docker image layers and the bare clone cache, so
every run after the first starts from both. A machine that must also pull or
build the image pays more, by an amount this recipe does not measure, and the
gap is large: an earlier 3-run median on this same host, reported as its first
real launch, was 33.204s.

Every number in the two paragraphs above was copied into this prose by hand,
which is how they came to outlive the build that produced them. `--record` is
how that stops: it writes the same invocation as one JSON object
a trend job can upload without anyone reading it.

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_launch.py -n 5 --record warm.json --shape warm \
    -- dl-next owner/repo -- true
```

The record holds the command, the run count, each run's wall time and
per-stage seconds, and the medians of those, and nothing else, because a CI
job stamps its own commit, clock and host better than this script can. Four
things about it are load-bearing:

- **The median is the point, the runs are its evidence.** A trend compares a
  point against the immediately previous one, so N runs published as N points
  would read ordinary spread as a regression.
- **A stage no run reported is absent, not zero.** A warm launch legitimately
  has no cold-path stages; a zero would claim the work happened instantly
  rather than not at all. A stage only *some* runs reported is a median over
  those runs, carrying a count of how many. A median of two and a median of
  five are not the same claim.
- **Recording asks the launch for its stages** (`DEVLAUNCH_TIMING=json`), so a
  run that reports no timing document is an error and no record. Same
  discipline as no median over a failed run.
- **`--shape` labels the trend line** (`warm`, `cold-recreate`). It is the
  caller's to say: the same command benches either shape depending on
  `--before`, and a wrong label is worse in a trend than a missing one.

### The trend on main

Every push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/bench.yml`, which benches both
shapes on the runner and publishes one point per stage to
<https://blooop.github.io/devlaunch/dev/bench/>. It can also be dispatched by
hand. Reading it needs nothing but the chart; what follows is for changing it.

`scripts/bench_points.py` is the step between the two formats, bench records
in and one flat array of trend cases out:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_points.py warm.json cold-recreate.json --out bench.json \
    --require-stages-on cold-recreate
```

(`pixi run bench-points ...` in the devcontainer.) One case per stage the shape
reported, plus that shape's own total: `warm / host-prep`,
`cold-recreate / devpod-up`, `warm / total`. Six properties of it are
load-bearing:

- **The published value is the median, and the case name is a key.** The trend
  compares a point against the immediately previous point and nothing older, so
  the de-noising has to have happened before publishing. Renaming a stage
  starts a new, empty series beside a frozen old one.
- **The spread rides along as the point's error bar**, and the outside
  stopwatch (`wall=`) as part of its `extra`. Evidence beside the number,
  rather than a second trend line for the same launch that disagrees with the
  first by a constant.
- **An absent stage is absent.** A warm launch lends nothing, so there is no
  `warm / tools` case at all. Never a zero, which would claim an instantaneous
  lend and would drag the line down exactly where a regression should show.
- **`--require-stages-on` fails the job rather than the trend.** The way this
  decomposition is expected to break is an absence, not a wrong number: a stage
  stops being emitted and the total keeps working. So the cold-recreate shape,
  where every stage is known to be present, asserts them all, and a run that
  lost one publishes nothing and goes red. Naming a shape that was not benched
  fails too, since an assertion that covers nothing reads exactly like one that
  passed.
- **A record that is missing or unreadable refuses the same way.** The step
  that writes the records can exit 0 without having written one, so the absence
  arrives here. It prints `bench_points: <reason>` naming the file and
  writes nothing, like every other refusal, rather than a traceback.
- **A regression alerts; it never gates.** The workflow is deliberately not a
  job in `ci.yml`: a job there would join the CI gate's `needs` by house
  convention and turn a noisy wall-clock measurement into a merge gate. A point
  above the threshold leaves a commit comment and a red mark on the chart, and
  the build stays green.
